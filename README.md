Everything here should be considered to be in "perpetual rough draft mode" and taken with a big grain of salt. In contrast to [my blog](https://venpopov.com/posts), the notebooks here are not aimed at anyone in particular aside from myself. The name etudes was inspired by [Peter Norvig's pytudes GitHub repo](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/).
