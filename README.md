Everything here should be considered to be in "perpetual rough draft mode" and taken with a big grain of salt. In contrast to [my blog](https://venpopov.com/posts), the notebooks here are not aimed at anyone in particular aside from myself. The name etudes was inspired by [Peter Norvig's pytudes GitHub repo](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/). The are projects large and small, in which I explore new skills or interesting problems; projects that I want to preserve more than my messy 'sandbox' folder with various scripts, but that are not ready or intended for any type of spotlight. Some of them might eventually make it over to my blog, research projects, course materials, but most will probably enjoy the solitude and judgement-free zone that this little corner provides.
